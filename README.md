# Gatekeeper Bot

Gatekeeper is a Discord bot designed to prevent spam bots and self-bots from joining your server. It verifies the identity of users before granting them access to your server, ensuring that only legitimate users are allowed to join.

## Work in Progress

Gatekeeper is currently a work in progress, and we are actively developing all features and functionalities. If you have any suggestions or feedback, we would love to hear from you!

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the Gatekeeper bot.
